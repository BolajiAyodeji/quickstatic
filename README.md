# QuickStatic ðŸš€ðŸ¦€ðŸ”¥

A fast static site generator written in Rust ðŸ¦€ðŸš€.

## Priorities 
- Simplicity 
- Stable (Few features, and should not change very much)
- Content first. A QuickStatic site should show the content first, and hide themes or configuration away. We spend more time writing content than editing website templates and configs.
- Super flexible markdown, via extended markdown specifications.
- Never support MDX (React in markdown). Instead, depend on markdown directives and the markdown attributes extended spec.
- No asset management or SCSS or LESS or any other automated transpiler support. 
- Build on top of shopify liquid templates. 
- Prioritize productivity

QuickStatic generates static websites, and focuses on doing that in a flexible and fast way.
